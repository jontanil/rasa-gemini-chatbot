The repo contains a training project done by me in order to learn more about Conversational AIs and usage of LLMs in our projects. The project is a Conversational AI chatbot which can collect contact data from clients and store them in a csv file. As an additional functionality, the chatbot can access your csv documents and summarize its contents for you on demand.
*Conversations handled by RASA 3.x.x Framework
*Document summarization handled using Google Gemini
